## Engine and DCC communication system

SkyHook was created to facilitate communication between DCCs, standalone applications, web browsers and game engines. As of right now, itâ€™s working in Houdini, Blender, Maya, Substance Painter and Unreal Engine.

The current mainline version is for Python 3.6 and up. 

SkyHook consist of 2 parts that can, but donâ€™t have to, work together. Thereâ€™s a client and a server. The server is just a very simple HTTP server that takes JSON requests. It parses those requests and tries to execute what was in them. The client just makes a a POST request to the server with a JSON payload. This is why you can basically use anything thatâ€™s able to do so as a client. Could be in a language other than Python, or even just webpage or mobile application.
